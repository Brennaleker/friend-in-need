##Problem Statement
During Januaryâ€™s 1-night count over 10,000 homeless individuals were counted in King County and the number of those staying outdoors increased by 21% from the count in 2014. Shelters and soup kitchens are scrambling for resources to serve the population. There are many people who would like to help but want to know without a doubt how their money will be used. This project would connect donors with organizations via wishlists in the style of DonorsChoose.org and guarantee that the money donated is used for the products requested.

##User Personas 
- shelters and soup kitchens requesting supplies
- individuals and companies hoping to lend a helping hand
- individuals who are willing to donate their time to verify requests

##Research
_Existing Sites_
Individual organization sites asking for specific needs (feminine hygiene products, toilet paper, toothbrushes, blankets, etc.)
_Other Info._
Donating to organizations that aid the homeless rather than directly to a homeless individual
